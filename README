####
enjalot's modifications to Blender, putting the RTPS library in the Game Engine

Build: 
(Sorry, only Mac and Linux are tested right now)
right now my changes depend on my RTPS library:
http://github.com/enjalot/EnjaParticles
    git clone git://github.com/enjalot/EnjaParticles.git

check this out and switch to branch rtps
    cd EnjaParticles
    git checkout rtps

follow the README to build, you will need to set an environment variable so that the Blender CMake can find the RTPS library
the RTPS library path should be something like
~/EnjaParticles/rtps/build/rtpslib/librtps.so

you need to set an environment variable like:
    export RTPS_DIR=$HOME/EnjaParticles/rtps
an example is given in environment/setupenv_linux_enj.sh

Build Blender:
    cd ..
    mkdir build-b25rtps
    cd build-b25rtps
    cmake ../BGERTPS/blender    (Mac users may want to run ccmake ../BGERTPS/blender to configure properly)
        (make sure to check that all the libraries and dependencies are found)
    make -j8    (j8 runs make in 8 threads, if you encounter an error rerun make by itself to get sequential error output)
    
    



Usage:
You can apply the RTPS modifier to an object which turns its vertices into an emitter





Changes:
Check MODIFIED_FILES for a more indepth list of changes

I added opencl headers with slight modification in the intern/ directory

The most important aspects of the gameengine changes are in
gameengine/Converter/BL_ModifierDeformer.cpp (in the Apply and Update functions)
The rendering chain gets hijacked in RAS_MaterialBucket.cpp and then RAS_ListRasterizer.cpp

You can see refer to my blog to see how I made the custom modifier:
http://enja.org/2010/05/24/blender-creating-a-custom-modifier/

I had to make some changes to several header files so we don't include any gl.h or glext.h before glew.h







I will continue to add more as experimentation. In the future I hope to integrate with the 2.5 blender particle redesign
right now I'm still finding my way around blender and opencl
